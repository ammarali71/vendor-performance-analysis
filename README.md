## Project Summary


This project analyzes vendor performance and sales data within an inventory management system, covering the complete data lifecycle—from raw data ingestion and ETL processing to in-depth analysis and interactive visualization. The primary objective is to evaluate vendor efficiency, uncover sales and profitability trends, and generate actionable insights to support data-driven business decisions.

The project demonstrates hands-on expertise in Python, SQL, data analysis, ETL workflows, and Power BI dashboard development.

## 📊 Summary Statistics Insights

### ⚠️ Negative & Zero Values
- **Gross Profit (Min: -52,002.78)**  
  Some transactions are running at a loss due to high costs or heavy discounting.
- **Profit Margin (Min: -∞)**  
  Revenue is zero or lower than costs, indicating unprofitable sales.
- **Total Sales Quantity & Sales Dollars (Min: 0)**  
  Products were purchased but never sold, suggesting slow-moving or obsolete inventory.

### 🔍 Outliers & High Variability
- **Purchase & Actual Prices**  
  Maximum values (5,681.81 / 7,499.99) compared to low mean values (24.39 / 35.64) indicate the presence of premium or high-end products.
- **Freight Cost (0.09 → 257,032.07)**  
  Large variation points to bulk shipments or inefficiencies in logistics.
- **Stock Turnover (0 → 274.5)**  
  Some products sell extremely fast while others barely move.  
  Stock turnover greater than 1 indicates sales fulfilled from older inventory.

### 💡 Key Takeaways
- Monitor loss-making products and negative margins for corrective action.
- Investigate high freight costs and extreme stock turnover to optimize logistics.
- Implement strategies to reduce slow-moving or obsolete inventory.

## 🧹 Data Filtering

To improve data quality and reliability, the following filters were applied:

- **Gross Profit ≤ 0** – Excluded loss-making transactions.
- **Profit Margin ≤ 0** – Focused analysis on profitable sales.
- **Total Sales Quantity = 0** – Removed items that were never sold.
